# CSCI3170 Group Project
## Introduction
You are required to implement a sales system for a computer part store so that all information about 
transactions, computer parts and salespersons is stored. The system has to support interactive inquiries 
from users. You are required to use Java JDBC API to access the database and implement a Java 
application to satisfy all system functions defined in this specification.

There are two phases. In phase 1, you are required to design the database for the sales system 
(including an ER-diagram and a relational schema which doesn't contain redundant fields and tables). 
After the deadline of Phase 1, a suggested solution will be provided. You are required to use the 
suggested solution as a guideline to complete Phase 2. In Phase 2, you are required to implement the
sales system as a Java command-line program. Our tutors will give tutorials on how to connect to MySQL
database system through Java JDBC API and deploy your work on the required platform.

This is a group project and each group consists of three members. Each group is required to submit ONLY 
one solution for each project phase. Please sign the group registration form on the course homepage 
before the group registration deadline
